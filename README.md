## About the game
Your objective is to arrange the numbered tiles from 1 to 15 in order, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.

Playing this game is very simple: all you have to do is to click on any tile adjacent to the empty space to slide it into the empty position. You can only move tiles that are next to the empty space. Move tiles strategically to gradually organize them.
